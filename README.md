This is an unfinished iOS application.  Originally it was meant to be an internal application for Work Life at my company.  There was a question about distribution and authentication that derailed this project.  I was using this more as a learning tool anyways to see how much had changed in the iOS SDK.  This project has a dependency on the Kal plugin which I believe is no longer maintained.  

Technical Details
This application interfaced with a set of REST endpoints which I implemented.  Instead of creating a lot of domain objects I simply stored the domain in dictionaries using the newer JSON api.  It was a quicky and dirty scaffold to see what was possible.
